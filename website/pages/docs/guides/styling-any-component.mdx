# Styling any component

`twc` can be used on all your own or third-party components as long as they accept a `className` prop.

## Usage

In this example, we style a `next/link` by specifying `twc(Link)`:

```tsx
import Link from "next/link";
import { twc } from "react-twc";

const Link = twc(Link)`underline text-blue-800 hover:text-blue-900`;
```
